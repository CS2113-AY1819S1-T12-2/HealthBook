== Project: Health Book

---

== Overview

Health Book is an address book application that is catered for healthcare professionals who seek to retrieve their patientsâ€™ personal information and health-related information all in one place. A Command Line Interface (CLI) is utilized mainly for the input, while a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to display the output. By combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI. It is written in Java.

My team comprised of a Project Manager, Development Lead, Quality Assurance Lead, Design Lead, and Subject Matter Expert for documentation and application workflow. For this project, I took up the role of Development Lead, and was in charge of setting the technical direction of the team.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *add, view, edit and delete appointments for a patient*
** What it does: allows the user to manage appointments for a patient.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can track his patients' appointments easily and make sure that there are no scheduling clashes, and can also remind his patients in advance that they have appointments.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* *Minor enhancement*: added an *information panel for the displaying of patient information like medical histories and appointments* on the right side of the main app

* *Code contributed*: (https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=brandonccm1996[Code Dashboard])

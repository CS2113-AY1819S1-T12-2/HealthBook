== PROJECT: Health Book

---

== Overview

Health Book is an address book application that is catered for healthcare professionals who seek to retrieve their patientsâ€™ personal information and health-related information all in one place. Command Line Interface is utilized mainly for the input, while GUI is used mainly to display the output. By combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI. It is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add, view, edit and delete appointments in a patient's timetable*
** What it does: allows the user to manage appointments for a patient.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can track his patients' appointments easily and make sure that there are no scheduling clashes, and can also remind his patients in advance that they have appointments.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
